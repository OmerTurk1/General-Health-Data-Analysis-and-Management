# General Health Data Analysis and Management

This repository demonstrates a complete workflow for learning data analytics and machine learning using a real-world healthcare dataset.

## Data
The dataset contains 100,000 rows and is split into 80% training and 20% testing sets.  
It consists of 43 columns, where 3 columns have a single unique value and 10 columns contain missing values.

## Objective
The main objective of this project is to build a model that determines whether a person is healthy or diseased.  

Data analysis and visualization are performed to better understand the dataset and extract meaningful insights.  
Outlier handling is applied, as outliers can negatively affect the performance of machine learning models.  
Data imputation is performed to handle missing values, allowing the use of as much data as possible and improving model robustness.  
Finally, a predictive model is trained, which can later be used to evaluate a person's general health condition.

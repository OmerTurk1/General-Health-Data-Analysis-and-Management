# General-Health-Data-Analysis-and-Management
This repository has a workflow that used to learn data analytics and machine learning.
## Data
Data has 100,000 rows in it, splitted by %80 train and %20 test data ratio.  
Data has a total of 43 columns, 3 of them has single value, and 10 of them has missing values in that.

## Objective
The main objective is to build a model which determines whether a person is healthy or diseased.  
Data analytics and visualization is performed in order to understand the work model, giving such useful insights about the data.  
Outlier handling is performed. This is crucial because outliers may affect the performance of the eventual model, and need to be held.  
Data Imputation is crucial as it provides the usage of rows with missing values. Filling as much gaps as we can will provide a better understanding power.  
Lastly, the final model is trained. This model will later be used to measure a person's general health.
